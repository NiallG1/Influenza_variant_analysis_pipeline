# Influenza_variant_analysis_pipeline
This pipeline functions to carry out subtyping and variant analysis on the sequencing data generated by the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) Ireland.
Each sequence is compared against 30 reference sequences obtained from the World Health Orgnaisation using Blast, a pairwise alignment is then carried out
on each sequence with its most similar reference sequence. The positions where a nucelotide substitution has occurred as well as the change in single nucleotide are outputted 
into a csv file. The query sequences and references sequences are the converted into amino acids, and the same pairwise alignment is carried out, producing
a csv file containing all amino acid substitutions and postions, as well as the a prediction of the change in protein produced from this substitution.
